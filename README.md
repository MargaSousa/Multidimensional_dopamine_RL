# Multidimensional_dopamine_RL

# Introduction  

This code was used for studying the **Dopamine neurons encode a multidimensional probabilistic map of future reward.**

# Usage

This code was developed in Python 3. All required packages are in the _requirements.txt_ file. 

To produce Figure 1, Figure 6, Extended data Figure 10 and Extended data Figure 11, please run the respective scripts. 

_Fig1a_c, Figb, Fig1d_left, Fig6c, Fig6e, Ext_data_Fig10_ and _Ext_data_Fig10_ run in less than 10 seconds on a MacBook Pro M2 with 8GB of RAM (macOS 13.0). Simulation_Fig6 takes 20 seconds to run.
